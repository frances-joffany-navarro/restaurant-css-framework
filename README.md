# Restaurant Website Project

This project contains a fictional restaurant website named ***Ka\[mains\]yan***. This name derived from the word "Kamayan". It is a Filipino word means "eat with your hands". This is a traditionnal way of eating in the Philippines. 


The purpose of this project is to familiarize the learners in using Bootstrap. Its duration is 4 days so I created a timeline to manage my time in this stages.
